# AI College Project ðŸš€

This project implements the A* search algorithm and machine learning models (Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron) for drug classification.

## A* Search Algorithm ðŸŒŸ

The A* search algorithm is implemented to find the optimal path in a graph. The graph represents different drugs and their connections.

### How to Run the A* Search Algorithm

1. Open the `project(A_star).py` file.
2. Run the script.
3. Follow the interactive prompts to enter the drug you need.
4. The script will display the solution path and the cost of the solution.

## Machine Learning Models ðŸ¤–

This project also includes the implementation of Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers to predict drug types based on various features.

### How to Run the Machine Learning Models

1. Open the `final_project.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
2. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the models.
3. The notebook will display the results of the Decision Tree and MLP classifiers.

### Libraries Used ðŸ“š

- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Results ðŸ“Š

The results of the models are displayed in the notebook, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## License ðŸ“„
